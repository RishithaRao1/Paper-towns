Problem Statement:
India witnesses a heartbreaking paradox where 40% of its food ends up in the bin. Despite adequate food production, the UN has reported that about 190 million Indians remain undernourished. It is further estimated that value of food wastage in India is around â‚¹92,000 crores per annum. one-third of all food in India is wasted or gets spoilt before it is eaten
"Many households struggle with food wastage due to unnoticed expiry dates on products. This leads to both financial losses and a larger food waste problem. 
The challenge is to create a way to easily track expiry dates and encourage timely consumption or donation of items.
Our solution, the Expiry Tracker using Barcode and OCR, allows users to scan barcodes or take pictures of products with their smartphones. Using Optical Character Recognition (OCR), important information like product name, manufacturer, and expiry date is extracted. 
As the expiry date nears, the app reminds users to take action, promoting responsible usage and reducing food waste."
